# Escape Room Webpages

The webpages are intended to be used as pieces of an escape room. I used JavaScript to add functionality to the webpages, such as confirming when a correct code is entered. This was used in an at home escape room I created. For the sake of seeing the working webpages, the correct colour combination is red, blue, green, then yellow.
