# Escape Room Webpages

These webpages were created to be used as pieces of an escape room. I used JavaScript to add functionality to the webpages, such as confirming when a correct code is entered. This was used in an at-home escape room I created. For the sake of seeing the working webpages, the correct colour combination is red, yellow, blue, then green. This brings up a page with an access code required. After inputting the code (1107) the background is updated with an image that serves as a clue to further the puzzle.
